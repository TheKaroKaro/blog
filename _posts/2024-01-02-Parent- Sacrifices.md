I was having dinner with friends

There\'s a woman

Working so hard to promote her restaurant menu to the customers

She has the skill

A good marketer

A good promoter

She\'s serving other customers, I look at her face.

I realize, she looks like fool in some moments, throwing dry jokes.

Exhaustion reflected through her face.

She hides it with her smile, laugh and cheerful face.

But I can see through her expression mask

She was tired of this job, this life

I saw her 2lil boys helping her

The elder boy shouted at her.

He couldn\'t find the table that ordered the dish he\'s carrying.
\"WHERE!?\"

It brings me back to my old day\'s memory

When I was a boy who;

Complain when my parents ask me to help

Shout angrily when my parents gave the wrong instructions

I get to my senses

I was so wrong about my life, about that woman.

She isn\'t hiding her exhaustion.

She really smile&laugh.

She knows that\'s exactly what a mom has to do to feed her children.

Parent\'s sacrifices are so huge that can never be repaid.
