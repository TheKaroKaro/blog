<meta name="description" content="I was on my way to the airport Early in the morning not many taxis around Thanks to the magic we called Technology I could book taxi with just an app in a mobile phone I realize something was going to be different that day Apparently the taxi driver was friendly Exciting chat was inevitable and that was the remedy for us to cure the boredom of the long journey to the airport.\ There was an interesting story he shared with me He asked if I believe in the concept of God has plan for all of us Well I was not ready to talk about this kind of thing at that moment I thought he was on the mission to market a religion or something But still, I said yea, kinda, but this depends on your faith. The taxi driver replied “Exactly, I do believe in that as well.” Then the taxi driver begin to talk about his experience regarding God works in his life There is one time I have a pregnant lady as my passenger on the way to the destination, she suddenly feels pain She told me that this is confirmed I was ….. what&#39;s confirmed? She said “The baby, it is time.” As soon as I heard that I was panicking Traffic at that time? Terrible and hospital was no where near I tried to cut lanes, honking and put on my car radio shouting that there&#39;s emergency please give ways. I did not notice that there was a police chasing me that time I rolled down my window The police asked me why I was driving like a crazy man? I just said that it was an emergency, pregnant lady about to give birth.\ The police check on the rear seats to confirm and soon after He said come follow me I end up being escorted to the hospital. I was thinking, that was not a coincidence A police was there and escorted us? In a terrible traffic? Thank God Soon after arrival I go out and ask for the medical staff to escort the lady Before she goes, she ask me how much for the fare and I said no, consider that as a baby gift, congratulation. I hope that they would be okay I couldn&#39;t ask for the fare coz that was emergency She was in pain I had to prioritize life over money I&#39;m happy that I could deliver the lady to the hospital on time I went to Petron to refuel my taxi Apparently there was one guy asking me if I could take him to Pavilion. I Said come in It&#39;s just great to get another passenger. After dropping that passenger, Another guy with a short pants looking for taxi to send him to KLIA. I just wonder what a lucky day today I get passenger after passenger without have to wait in the taxi lane or wondering around wasting petrol hunting passenger. In the middle of our journey I asked that guy “Sir, Are you sure wearing this kinda short pants to KLIA?” Then he replied me “Why not? As long as its not your wallet that&#39;s short.” and we both laugh After I drop that guy at KLIA, He pay me double He gave me RM200 for RM 70something fares I was just shock Its like more than double. Then the taxi driver told me You see here, This is the baby that pays me This is God&#39;s way to return my favour of helping that pregnant lady I get even more than the fare she should pay I just feel that this is beautiful God always watching all of our actions and He will pay those who did good deeds After that story I was thinking and what caught my interest was that this taxi driver is always grateful for things that happened to him even when he just found passenger on Petron even when he coincidentally met the police which in the end help to escort him Its just beautiful how people can live with such a personality Being thankful for things Appreciating life As I being surrounded by negativity this lately I feel a little enlighten by this I guess God really have plan for us then?\" />

    <p>I was on my way to the airport</p>

<p>Early in the morning not many taxis around<br />
Thanks to the magic we called Technology<br />
I could book taxi with just an app in a mobile phone<br />
I realize something was going to be different that day<br />
Apparently the taxi driver was friendly<br />
Exciting chat was inevitable<br />
and that was the remedy for us to cure the boredom of the long journey
to the airport.\</p>

<p>There was an interesting story he shared with me<br />
He asked if I believe in the concept of God has plan for all of us<br />
Well<br />
I was not ready to talk about this kind of thing at that moment<br />
I thought he was on the mission to market a religion or something<br />
But still, I said yea, kinda, but this depends on your faith.<br />
<br />
The taxi driver replied “Exactly, I do believe in that as well.”<br />
Then the taxi driver begin to talk about his experience regarding God
works in his life</p>

<p>There is one time I have a pregnant lady as my passenger<br />
on the way to the destination, she suddenly feels pain<br />
She told me that this is confirmed<br />
I was ….. what's confirmed?<br />
She said “The baby, it is time.”<br />
As soon as I heard that I was panicking<br />
Traffic at that time?<br />
Terrible and hospital was no where near<br />
<br />
I tried to cut lanes, honking and put on my car radio shouting that
there's emergency please give ways.<br />
I did not notice that there was a police chasing me that time<br />
I rolled down my window<br />
The police asked me why I was driving like a crazy man?<br />
I just said that it was an emergency, pregnant lady about to give
birth.\</p>

<p>The police check on the rear seats to confirm and soon after<br />
He said come follow me<br />
I end up being escorted to the hospital.<br />
<br />
I was thinking, that was not a coincidence<br />
A police was there and escorted us? In a terrible traffic?<br />
Thank God<br />
<br />
Soon after arrival I go out and ask for the medical staff to escort the
lady<br />
Before she goes, she ask me how much for the fare and I said no,
consider that as a baby gift, congratulation.<br />
<br />
I hope that they would be okay<br />
I couldn't ask for the fare coz that was emergency<br />
She was in pain<br />
I had to prioritize life over money<br />
I'm happy that I could deliver the lady to the hospital on time</p>

<p>I went to Petron to refuel my taxi<br />
Apparently there was one guy asking me if I could take him to Pavilion.<br />
I Said come in<br />
It's just great to get another passenger.<br />
After dropping that passenger, Another guy with a short pants looking
for taxi to send him to KLIA.<br />
I just wonder what a lucky day today<br />
I get passenger after passenger without have to wait in the taxi lane or
wondering around wasting petrol hunting passenger.<br />
In the middle of our journey I asked that guy<br />
“Sir, Are you sure wearing this kinda short pants to KLIA?”<br />
Then he replied me “Why not? As long as its not your wallet that's
short.”<br />
and we both laugh</p>

<p>After I drop that guy at KLIA, He pay me double<br />
He gave me RM200 for RM 70something fares<br />
I was just shock<br />
Its like more than double.<br />
<br />
Then the taxi driver told me<br />
You see here,<br />
This is the baby that pays me<br />
This is God's way to return my favour of helping that pregnant lady<br />
I get even more than the fare she should pay<br />
<br />
I just feel that this is beautiful<br />
God always watching all of our actions<br />
and He will pay those who did good deeds<br />
<br />
After that story<br />
I was thinking and what caught my interest was that this taxi driver is
always grateful for things that happened to him<br />
even when he just found passenger on Petron<br />
even when he coincidentally met the police which in the end help to
escort him<br />
<br />
Its just beautiful how people can live with such a personality<br />
Being thankful for things<br />
Appreciating life<br />
As I being surrounded by negativity this lately<br />
I feel a little enlighten by this<br />
I guess God really have plan for us then?\</p>
